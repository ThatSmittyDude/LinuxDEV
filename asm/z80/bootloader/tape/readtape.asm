; Define a flag to indicate when a new bit is ready
NEW_BIT_AVAILABLE EQU $FF00

; Load the Z80 data bus (DB) with the external input device
DB EQU $0000 			; Data Bus register (assuming an 8-bit data bus)

; Define a subroutine to input individual bits from the user
INPUT_BIT:
    MVI A, NEW_BIT_AVAILABLE 	; Load accumulator with the flag address
    IN A, (A) 			; Read input flag from external device (should be set when new bit is ready)
    JNZ GET_BIT 		; Jump if new bit available

GET_BIT:
    MOV B, #00 			; Initialize counter for 8-bit data bus
READ_BIT_LOOP:
    MVI C, #80 			; Load carry register with the mask value (for 1 bit)
    RLC A 			; Rotate accumulator left to select the next bit position
    JNC NEXT_BIT 		; Jump if current bit is 0 (or ignore)

    ; If the bit is set, input it onto the data bus
    MVI D, #01 			; Load data register with the mask value (for 1 bit)
    AND C 			; Mask off unwanted bits
    ORI A 			; Select the inputted bit and clear others

NEXT_BIT:

    				; Input the final selected bit onto the Z80 data bus
