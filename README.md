Some code I made for my linux workstation

To compile:

Copy code.zip and code.sh to your home folder. You can simply open a terminal where the file was downloaded and run: 
    cp code.zip code.sh ~/

Go to your home folder and run 
    sudo chmod +x code.sh

Then run 
    ./code.sh

Now you should be able to run any C++, C, and Fortran app from the command line
